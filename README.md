# VirtualSchestPlugin

VirtualSchestPlugin is a server-side plugin for Hytale that implements a virtual chest system.
The plugin allows you to create and use virtual chests that are not tied to physical blocks in the game world. Such chests can be used for item storage.

```bash
/virtualchest - open virtual chest
```
